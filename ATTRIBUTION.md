# Attribution

This project is based on and inspired by the **Compound Engineering Plugin** developed by EveryInc.

## Original Work

- **Repository**: [EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin)
- **Authors**: EveryInc team
- **License**: MIT License
- **Concept**: Compound Engineering methodology for exponential development efficiency

## What We've Adapted

### Core Philosophy
The fundamental principle that each solved problem should make future problems easier to solve, creating compound interest in engineering effort rather than compound complexity.

### Three-Phase Workflow
- **Plan Phase**: Deep research and strategic planning before implementation
- **Work Phase**: Test-driven development in isolated git worktrees
- **Review Phase**: Multi-persona code review for comprehensive quality assurance

### Knowledge Codification
The practice of extracting lessons learned and architectural decisions from each engineering session, creating a persistent knowledge base that improves over time.

### Git Worktree Integration
Using isolated development environments to enable safe parallel development and reduce merge conflicts.

## Our Implementation

This repository adapts the original plugin concepts into:

1. **Standalone System**: No plugin dependencies, works with any AI assistant that can read markdown files
2. **Cross-Platform Automation**: PowerShell and Bash scripts for git worktree management
3. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed workflows, protocols, and troubleshooting guides
4. **Memory System**: Persistent tracking of lessons and decisions across sessions
5. **AGENTS.md Constitution**: A single file that defines the complete operational framework

## Differences from Original

- **Implementation**: Standalone markdown-driven system vs. plugin architecture
- **Platform Support**: Cross-platform scripts vs. single environment
- **Documentation**: Extensive documentation hierarchy in `.ai/docs/` vs. plugin-embedded docs
- **Memory Persistence**: File-based memory system vs. plugin state management
- **Automation**: Custom git worktree scripts vs. plugin-provided automation

## Acknowledgments

We are deeply grateful to EveryInc for:

1. **Pioneering the Methodology**: Creating and open-sourcing the Compound Engineering approach
2. **Community Contribution**: Making these powerful concepts available to the broader development community
3. **Innovation**: Demonstrating how AI-assisted development can be systematized for exponential improvement
4. **Inspiration**: Providing the foundation that enabled this standalone implementation

The original Compound Engineering Plugin represents a significant advancement in AI-assisted software development methodology, and this project aims to extend its reach and accessibility.
